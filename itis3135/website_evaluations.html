            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-15-pro/">Apple - iPhone 15 Pro</a></h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">This page on the official Apple website presents the new iPhone 15 Pro's features. It is a simplistic, yet exemplary website.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>C</b>ontrast - The overall theme of the website uses black and dark colors, as if it were a showroom. White text is used as a contrast to the background along with well-lit images.</li>
                <li><b>R</b>epetition - For each important feature there is a dedicated section. Withing each section are consistent typography decisions and similar design elements such as the popping-up learn more button.</li>
                <li><b>A</b>lignment - Text, images, and other design elements are centered along the center, and more elaborate the text within the elements is usually left-aligned.</li>
                <li><b>P</b>roximity - Within each feature's division the images and other design elements share good spacing inbetween regardless of the screen dimensions. The divisions themselves are spread out in way which allows focus on one at a time.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.duke-energy.com/our-company/about-us">Duke Energy - About Us</a></h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">This page on the Duke Energy website provides information about what they do and factual information. It is a website that could use some work.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>C</b>ontrast - For the most part the contrast is alright, however gray paragraph font color on the lighter gray background can be eye straining for prolonged reading.</li>
                <li><b>R</b>epetition - Icons under "Quick facts about us" and under the "More about us" seem to adhere to one design code, however they are of significantly different sizes.</li>
                <li><b>A</b>lignment - While the all of the elements follow center alignment, the whole paragraph text is also center aligned.</li>
                <li><b>P</b>roximity - In some places padding and margins between sections too small, but some are alright, creating some inconsistency.</li>
            </ul>
